# Research: GitHub Copilot Now Fixes Failing CI with One Click

**Date range:** 2026-04-23 to 2026-05-21

## Summary

GitHub shipped a "Fix with Copilot" button directly on the GitHub Actions workflow run logs page on May 18, 2026. When a job fails, Copilot Business and Enterprise subscribers click the button and Copilot cloud agent investigates the failure, pushes a fix to the branch, and tags the developer for review. The agent runs in its own cloud-based development environment (powered by GitHub Actions) and reruns CI to confirm the fix before surfacing the result. Primary use cases cited: fixing tests and correcting linter failures.

This builds on a March 2026 capability: `@copilot Fix the failing tests` in a PR comment already triggered the same loop. The May change moves the entry point to the failure itself rather than requiring a separate PR comment.

Supporting context from the same period:

- April 23: Better stack-trace debugging in Copilot Chat on GitHub.com — structured root-cause analysis with what failed, why, probable root cause, code evidence, and suggested fix.
- April 27: Copilot cloud agent startup times cut another 20% (on top of a 50% reduction shipped in March), making the feedback loop from failure to fix materially faster.
- Copilot cloud agent requires an administrator to enable it for Copilot Business/Enterprise accounts before the Fix with Copilot button appears.

The angle for the post: for teams already living with flaky or brittle tests in CI (especially Playwright selector failures), the one-click repair path changes the cost calculus for fixing rather than tolerating failures.
